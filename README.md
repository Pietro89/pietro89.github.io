# Work With Me

## My personality - The "Joyful INTJ"

I am an **[INTJ — "The Architect"](https://www.16personalities.com/intj-personality)**—strategic, independent thinkers who see life as a giant chess game, driven to master complex systems and turn ideas into reality. However, I break the stereotype: I care deeply about team health. I'm the person who brings joy and cheer to the standup, ensuring everyone feels heard and understood. I believe a healthy team environment is a prerequisite for high-quality code.

## 🚀 Engineering Philosophy: Value > Tech

I am a backend-focused software engineer, but I am **not** a technical purist. To me, technology is a means to an end.

I am obsessed with **business results** and **real-world value**. That thirst for value is exactly what makes architecting features and coding them so appealing to me—I love building the engine that drives the result. I am a polyglot who picks the right tool based on performance, maintainability, and scale.

## 💻 The Hacker Mindset

I approach engineering with a bold, experimental edge. I don't just want things to work; I want to know *how they break*.

- **The Buzz of the Quick Win:** I am always in search of that "buzz"—the dopamine hit that comes from a rapid prototype, a clever optimization, or a quick win that moves the needle for the business.

- **Tinkering & Breaking:** I have a classic hacker mentality. I love picking up new technologies, pushing them to their limits, and intentionally breaking them to understand their underlying architecture.

- **Security-First Curiosity:** My desire to break things is paired with a deep respect for security. I am constantly on the hunt for security flaws and edge-case vulnerabilities. I believe the best way to build a secure system is to think like the person trying to bypass it.

## ⚡ How I Work

### Focus Time & Optimization

I am obsessed with time optimization. To produce my best work, I protect my focus blocks fiercely:

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Deep Work** | I schedule "No-Meeting" blocks in my calendar. |
| **Flow State** | When I'm in the zone, Slack notifications are off. This allows me to deliver high-value work without fragmentation. |
| **Efficiency** | I constantly optimize my developer environment to reduce friction and repetitive tasks. |

### Async-First Workflow

I prefer organized, structured ways of working over the "let's hop on a call" culture.

| Tool | How I Use It |
|------|--------------|
| **Slack** | Threads are sacred. Please provide full context immediately so I can respond effectively when I break focus. |
| **Notion / Documentation** | This is the **Source of Truth**. If it's not documented, it doesn't exist. I prefer a well-structured document explaining the "Why" and "How" over a 30-minute verbal explanation. |
| **GitHub** | I use PR descriptions as a narrative. I love technical discussions inside the code where the context lives. Async code reviews are my primary feedback loop. |

> **My Commitment:** When I am not in deep work, I am highly responsive and answer quickly.
>
> **My Expectation:** I respect your focus time, but I value momentum. I expect a response once you've emerged from your deep work, with a maximum acceptable delay of **one business day**.

## 📅 Meeting Manifesto

I strongly oppose "adding a meeting" as the default solution to uncertainty. Meetings are expensive and disruptive to engineering flow.

### 🚫 Why I'm Protective of Our Time (The Science)

My preference for async work isn't just a personal quirk—it's based on the reality of cognitive labor:

1. **The Cost of Interruption:** Research (UC Irvine) shows it takes an average of **23 minutes and 15 seconds** to return to the original task after an interruption. A "quick 10-minute sync" actually costs us 35 minutes of productivity.

2. **The Maker's Schedule:** As an engineer, I operate on a "Maker's Schedule" (Paul Graham). Meetings at 11:00 AM or 2:00 PM don't just take an hour; they fragment the day into blocks too small to achieve "Flow."

3. **Meeting Recovery Syndrome (MRS):** Studies show that employees need time to mentally "recover" from a bad meeting, leading to lower cognitive performance for up to 45 minutes after the meeting ends.

### 🚫 Meetings I Avoid

- Status updates that could be a Slack message
- Meetings without a clear agenda or desired outcome
- Large "broadcast" meetings where documentation would suffice

### ✅ Meetings I Value

- **Social Interaction:** Building empathy, team joy, and human connection
- **Brainstorming:** High-bandwidth sessions to solve complex blockers or architectural puzzles together
- **Work Sessions:** Real-time collaboration on a specific, difficult problem

## ❤️ The Human Element

I care deeply about my coworkers. I strive to make work a positive, healthy, and fulfilling experience for everyone involved.

### 🗣️ Communication Is Key

I help team members understand one another's perspectives, translating complex technical or personal friction into clear, solvable communication. Misunderstandings are rarely about the code—they're about assumptions. I bridge that gap.

### 🤝 Radical Support

If a colleague is struggling with a blocker, I am the first to offer a pair-programming session—even if I have zero context on the problem. It's not about having the answers; it's about ensuring no one feels isolated. We solve it together.

### 😄 Positive Culture

I intentionally bring humor and joy into our daily interactions. I believe work is better when we can laugh while we build. I enjoy (almost) every minute of my job and do everything possible to make my teammates feel the same.

### 🚫 Zero Tolerance for Toxicity

A healthy team requires boundaries. I do not tolerate behaviors that poison the well, including:

- **Blame-shifting:** Pointing fingers instead of focusing on solutions
- **Gatekeeping:** Hoarding knowledge or dismissing questions as "too basic"
- **Passive aggression:** Sarcasm, backhanded compliments, or weaponized silence
- **Public shaming:** Criticizing someone's work in a way meant to embarrass rather than educate
- **Dismissiveness:** Shutting down ideas without consideration (e.g., "That will never work")

When I see these behaviors, I address them directly and constructively—because protecting team culture is everyone's responsibility.
